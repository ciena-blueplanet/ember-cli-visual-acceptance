* Make the directory `default/` rather than '`<element-width>x<element-height>/`. This does not affect elements where the size is specified.
  * This will help scenarios where targeted element show up as `New` rather than `Changed` simply b/c the size of the target changed.
  *  Also it's easier to navigate instead of having to open every folder to see where the target element is located
